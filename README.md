1. **Prototype First**: Started by building `flexbox.html` with placeholder sections to define structure using Flexbox.
2. **Final Integration**: Migrated the flex layout into `youtube.html`, replacing placeholders with actual content such as thumbnails, titles, and metadata.
3. **Styling Enhancements**:
   - Applied `flex-shrink: 0`, `min-width`, and media queries for responsive control.
   - Integrated custom components like a horizontal and vertical guide line to enhance visual balance.
4. **Responsive Fixes**: Ensured mobile responsiveness using media queries and width adjustments for `.second` and `.third` containers.
5. **Clickable Enhancements**: Enabled redirection on thumbnails by wrapping `<img>` tags in anchor links.
